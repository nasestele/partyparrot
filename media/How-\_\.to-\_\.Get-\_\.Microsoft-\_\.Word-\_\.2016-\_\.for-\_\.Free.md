The good news is that there are some options to get Microsoft Word 2016 for free, depending on your needs and preferences. Here are some of them:
 
- **Download the free trial version.** Microsoft offers a free one-month trial of Office 365, which includes Word 2016 and other Office apps. You can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-office-365-proplus) and use it for 30 days without any limitations. However, you will need a Microsoft account and a credit card to sign up for the trial, and you will be charged automatically after the trial period ends unless you cancel beforehand.
- **Use Word for the web.** Word for the web is a free online version of Word that you can access from any browser. It has most of the basic features of Word 2016, such as formatting, spell check, and inserting images and tables. You can also collaborate with others in real time and save your documents to OneDrive. However, it does not have some of the advanced features of Word 2016, such as PDF editing, SmartArt, and mail merge. You can use Word for the web by logging in to [office.com](https://www.office.com/) with your Microsoft account.
- **Use Word for mobile devices.** Word for Android and iOS are free apps that you can download from the Google Play Store or the App Store. They have similar features to Word for the web, but they are optimized for touch screens and smaller screens. You can also sync your documents across your devices and access them offline. However, you will need a Microsoft account to use them, and some features may require an Office 365 subscription.

In conclusion, Microsoft Word 2016 is a great word processor that can help you with various tasks, but it is not free.
